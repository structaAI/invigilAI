This could be due to incorrect formatting in the label files.

        "The traceback shows a KeyError: 'image_path' when trying to group `gt_df` by 'image_path'. This indicates that the 'image_path' column was not successfully created in the `gt_df` DataFrame. Looking at the previous output, there are many \"Skipping malformed line\" warnings, which suggests that the `load_ground_truth` function is encountering lines in the label files that do not have the expected format and thus failing to append data to `gt_data`. This results in an empty `gt_df`. I need to re-examine the format of the ground truth label files that are causing the \"Expected 5 parts, got 9\" errors and adjust the parsing logic in `load_ground_truth` to correctly handle them. It seems the format might include polygon points after the bounding box, which are not needed for this task. I will update the parsing to specifically extract only the class ID and the four bounding box coordinates. I also noticed a typo in the `calculate_iou` function where `y2` was calculated incorrectly for `box1`. I will fix that as well.\n",
