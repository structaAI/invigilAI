# Issues Markdown File

Here we shall add issues with certain priority order:
  - CI (Critical Issue): This is something that has to be tended to ASAP (Highest priority)
  - MI (Moderate Issue): This is for certain bugs that don't compromise the entire system, but only a part (Medium Priority)
  - NI (Non-Issue): This is actually for adding something new (Low priority)

Upon discovering an issue, please add the issue to this document and (Optionally) create an issue directly on the repository itself
After completing work on an issue please remove the issue from the given markdown before pusing to master, if an issue was created in the repository, clear that aswell.
